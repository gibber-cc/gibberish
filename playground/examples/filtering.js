/* tutorial 3: filtering 
 *
 * There are currently five different filter models
 * in Gibberish.
 *
 * 1. Filter24Moog - 24db per octave "virtual analog" aka "zero-delay" ladder filter. lp.
 * 2. Filter24TB303 - 24db per octave "virtual analog" aka "zero-delay" diode filter. lp.
 * 3. Filter12SVF - (TEMPORARILY BROKEN). 12dB per octave state variable filter. lp, hp, bp, notch.
 * 4. Filter12Biquad - 12dB per octave biquad. lp, hp, bp.
 * 5. Filter24Classic - 24db per octave ladder filter (original Gibberish ladder filter). lp, hp.
 *
 * These filters can all be used independently or as a built-in part of the Synth, FM
 * and Monosynth instruments.

/* some instruments have filters built-in to them. The Monosynth and Synth
 * have filters enabled by default; for the FM instrument you'll  need to enable it by
 * setting the filterType variable to a non-zero value. These numbers correspond
 * to the list at the top of this tutorial, e.g. choose 3 to use the TB303 filter model.

 * of the filter, synths also have a filterMult property that
 * determines how much the synths envelope modulates the filter
 * by. E.g. if a synth has a cutoff frequency of 110, and a 
 * filterMult property of 1000, then the final filter cutoff will
 * travel between 110-1110 Hz over the envelope.
